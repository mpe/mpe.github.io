grandparents. It's quite a nice little device and had been doing a fairly good
job for a few months, but then all of a sudden some of the recordings wouldn't
play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To cut a long and boring story short, I eventually discovered that the device
had simply overwritten some of the recordings with others, ie. no I/O errors or
anything nasty, just a software bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the process I looked around for tools to examine FAT filesystems, and didn't
find much. If anyone knows of any I'd love to hear about them. In the absence of
a proper tool I bodged up some code to do what I needed - and &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; what
I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've thrown &lt;a href="http://michael.ellerman.id.au/files/junkcode/fat.c"&gt;the code&lt;/a&gt; up in case anyone else finds themselves in a similar
predicament. The idea is you dd the data off and point the code at it and
examine it, it's read only. It can dump the FAT, show you orphan clusters (with
no dentry pointing at them), search for a value, and save clusters or cluster
chains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Massive thanks to the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Allocation_Table"&gt;Wikipedia page on FAT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
