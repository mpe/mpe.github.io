The
QS22 is the newest &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_microprocessor"&gt;Cell processor&lt;/a&gt; based blade server, sporting the new
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_microprocessor#PowerXCell_8i"&gt;PowerXCell 8i&lt;/a&gt; chip, and up to 32 GB of memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the QS22 can support larger amounts of memory, Linux needs to enable the
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iommu"&gt;IOMMU&lt;/a&gt;, whereas on previous blades that was optional. For some workloads
this could lead to a performance loss, so I spent some time early this year
working on a &lt;a href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=commit;h=99e139126ab2e84be67969650f92eb37c12ab5cd"&gt;solution&lt;/a&gt; which avoids the IOMMU overhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although he's too modest to mention it, Jeremy maintains &lt;a href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/arch/powerpc/platforms/cell/spufs"&gt;spufs&lt;/a&gt;, which is
the key infrastructure in the kernel which enables the Cell processor's power -
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_microprocessor#Synergistic_Processing_Elements_.28SPE.29"&gt;the SPEs&lt;/a&gt;. If it wasn't for Benh, who also works with us in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra"&gt;Canberra&lt;/a&gt;,
the QS22 probably wouldn't even boot. And as of this year we've also had Mark,
the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_kids_on_the_block"&gt;NKOTB&lt;/a&gt;, working on Cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As of this week &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Roadrunner"&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/a&gt;, powered primarily by the QS22, is the current
world's fastest computer, according to the &lt;a href="http://top500.org/list/2008/06/100"&gt;Top 500&lt;/a&gt;. It's also the first
computer to break the "&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS"&gt;petaflop&lt;/a&gt; barrier". That means it can do 1
quadrillion calculations per second, that's the same as 1 million billion or
1000 trillion .. or &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did I mention it runs Linux :)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>LCA 08</title><link href="https://mpe.github.io/posts/2008/02/11/lca-08/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2008-02-11T00:01:00+11:00</published><updated>2008-02-11T00:01:00+11:00</updated><author><name>Michael Ellerman</name></author><id>tag:mpe.github.io,2008-02-11:/posts/2008/02/11/lca-08/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logo" src="/images/2008/lca-08.png" style="float: right"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phew. If you haven't seen or heard from me in the past few weeks, it's cause I
was flat out preparing for &lt;a href="http://linux.conf.au"&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt;, aka LCA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Phew. If you haven't seen or heard from me in the past few weeks, it's cause I
was flat out preparing for &lt;a href="http://linux.conf.au"&gt;linux.conf.au&lt;/a&gt;, aka LCA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I foolishly chose a talk topic which is entirely open-ended, it can never be
finished, leading to me spending endless days and nights working on it, always
thinking of "just one more thing" to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end the talk went down fairly well, I had more material than I needed -
preferable than the opposite situation. No one walked out, and everyone I've
talked to said they enjoyed it, so that'll do me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you weren't one of the blessed few there, there's a movie available &lt;a href="http://mirror.linux.org.au/pub/linux.conf.au/2008/Fri/mel8-190.ogg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;
(or &lt;a href="http://michael.ellerman.id.au/files/mel8-190.ogg"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and my slides are &lt;a href="http://michael.ellerman.id.au/files/ellerman-lca-08.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; - though they're not that useful on
their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also uploaded the &lt;a href="http://michael.ellerman.id.au/files/lca-2008-demo.avi"&gt;demo movie&lt;/a&gt;, if anyone wants to scrutinise it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the conference was a bit of a blur personally. I had a fair bit of
real work on leading up to it, and during, and also spent a lot of time working
on my talk. Lesson for future LCAs, finish the talk before going!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still managed to have a good time though, blur or not. The Penguin Dinner at
the Queen Vic markets was good fun, followed by beers on top of some office
block, and the PDNS was good fun as usual. The Google party was a pale imitation
of its former self, owing to there being no beer after 8:30pm, I guess they ran
out of cash?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackfest (programming competition) was a success, with quite a few entrants
and some pretty solid efforts by both the winners and some of the non-winners -
winning a Playstation 3 is obviously worth an all-nighter for a few people -
good to see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next year should be awesome, Tasmania is amazing, who's on for a "Riding up
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Wellington_(Tasmania)"&gt;Mt Wellington&lt;/a&gt;" BOF? ;)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="raytracing"></category></entry></feed>
